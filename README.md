# ✍️ AirDraw: Digit Recognition from Smartphone Motion Sensors

## ❓ Problem Statement: 

This project implements an **Air-Draw Digit Recognition System** that identifies digits (0–9) drawn in the air using smartphone motion sensors. Accelerometer and gyroscope data are collected via the **phyphox** mobile application and classified using a **CNN + LSTM deep learning model**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Users draw digits in the air using a smartphone.
- Motion sensor data is captured as time-series signals.
- Each recording is resampled to a fixed length.
- A deep learning model predicts the drawn digit.
- A Streamlit web app provides an interactive inference demo.

## 🎯 Skills Takeaway

By completing this project, learners gain hands-on experience in:

- Collecting time-series sensor data from smartphone IMU sensors
- Designing a structured data schema and storing sensor data in CSV format
- Preprocessing sequential data (resampling, normalization, padding/truncation)
- Building deep learning models for sequence classification using CNN and LSTM
- Evaluating multi-class classification models using appropriate metrics
- Deploying a simple inference pipeline using Streamlit
- Documenting and presenting an end-to-end deep learning project

## 📱 Data Collection

- **Sensors Used:**  
  - Accelerometer (ax, ay, az)  
  - Gyroscope (gx, gy, gz)
- **Tool:** phyphox Android app  
- **Sampling Rate:** 100 Hz  
- **Recording Duration:** 2 seconds per digit  

Each recording is stored as a CSV file with the following structure:
`timestamp`, `ax`, `ay`, `az`, `gx`, `gy`, `gz`

> ⚠️ The dataset is generated locally using the provided data collection script and is **not included** in this repository.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Timestamps aligned to start at 0 seconds
- Each sequence resampled to **T = 200 time steps**
- Feature normalization using StandardScaler (fit on training data only to prevent data leakage)
- The trained scaler is saved and reused during inference
- Final input tensor shape: **(200, 6)**

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **1D Convolutional Layers:** capture local motion patterns
- **LSTM Layer:** captures temporal dependencies
- **Dense Softmax Output:** 10 classes (digits 0–9)

**Input Shape:** `(200, 6)`  
**Output:** Digit class probabilities

## 📊 Model Performance

- Achieved **~96–98% accuracy** on the test set
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- The model generalizes well to unseen test samples across varying writing speeds within the collected dataset.
